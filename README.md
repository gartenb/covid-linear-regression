## __Using Linear Regression to Predict Covid-19 Active Infections__

__Files: How To Run__<br>
- [covid-linear-regression-database.py](google.com) : Be sure to have PostgreSQL installed. Make sure there is a User that can create and view databases (a superuser will work) [(Documentation)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-createuser.html). In the Main, change 'user', 'passw' and 'dbname' to your chosen PostgreSQL username, password and database name respectively. In terminal, 'cd' into the correct forlder, then use execute the command:<br>
		$ python covid-linear-regression-database.py<br>
- [covid-linear-regression.py](https://github.com/gartenb/covid-linear-regression/blob/master/covid-linear-regression.py) : This is a version of the previous program, without database functionality. To run the program, in terminal 'cd' into the correct forlder, then use execute the command:<br>
		$ python covid-linear-regression.py<br>
